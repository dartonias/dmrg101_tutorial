""" Calculates the ground state for the AF Heisenberg for two spins 1/2.

Calculates the ground state energy and wavefunction for the
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model for a system of two spin one-half. The
calculation of the ground state is done using the Lanczos algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------

    -----
        This function should raise an exception if the keys for the
