"""Implements the full DMRG algorithm for the S=1/2 AF Heisenberg.

Calculates the ground state energy and wavefunction for the
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model for a chain of spin one-half. The
calculation of the ground state is done using the full DMRG algorithm,
i.e. first the infinite algorithm, and then doing sweeps for convergence
with the finite algorithm.

Usage:
  heisenberg.py (-m=<states> -n=<sites> -s=<sweeps>) [--dir=DIR -o=FILE]
  heisenberg.py -h | --help

Options:
  -h --help         Shows this screen.
  -n <sites>        Number of sites of the chain.
  -m <states>       Number of states kept.
  -s <sweeps>       Number of sweeps in the finite algorithm.
  -o --output=FILE  Ouput file [default: heisenberg.dat]
  --dir=DIR         Ouput directory [default: ./]

    Calculates the truncation matrix by calculating the reduced density
    matrix for `ground_state_wf` by tracing out the degrees of freedom of
    the shrinking side. Then updates the operators you need in the next
    steps, effectively growing the size of the block by one site. 	
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    growing_block : a string.
        The block which is growing. It must be 'left' or 'right'.
    ground_state_wf : a Wavefunction.
        The ground state wavefunction of your system.
    system : a System object.
        The system you want to do the calculation on. This function
	assumes that you have set the Hamiltonian to something.
    number_of_states_kept : an int.
        The number of states you want to keep in each block after the
	truncation. If the `number_of_states_kept` is smaller than the
	dimension of the current Hilbert space block, all states are kept.
 
    Returns
    -------
    entropy : a double.
        The Von Neumann entropy for the cut that splits the chain into two
	equal halves.
    truncation_error : a double.
        The truncation error, i.e. the sum of the discarded eigenvalues of
	the reduced density matrix.

    therefore increasing by one site the number of sites encoded in the
    Hilbert space of this block, and reset the block in the system to be
    the new, enlarged, truncated ones. The other block is kept one-site
    long.

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : a System object.
        The system you want to do the calculation on. This function
	assumes that you have set the Hamiltonian to something.
    number_of_states_kept : an int.
        The number of states you want to keep in each block after the

	dimension of the current Hilbert space block, all states are kept.
 
    Returns
    -------
    energy : a double.
        The energy for the `current_size`.
    entropy : a double.
        The Von Neumann entropy for the cut that splits the chain into two
	equal halves.
    truncation_error : a double.
        The truncation error, i.e. the sum of the discarded eigenvalues of
	the reduced density matrix.

    Notes
    -----
    This asymmetric version of the algorithm when you just grow one of the
    block while keeping the other one-site long, is obviously less precise
    than the symmetric version when you grow both sides. However as we are
    going to sweep next using the finite algorithm we don't care much
    about precision at this stage.
